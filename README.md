This is early days test code to render LVGL via websocket to HTML Canvas using USB-Ethernet (cdc-ncm) @192.168.4.1
It should work on any esp32-s3 board with at least 8MB of flash and PSRAM >= 2MB plus a native USB1.1 full speed second usb conn.

It renders the LVGL frame buffers to a webpage canvas and feeds back mouse activity to the LVGL indev driver.
It sets up a new isolated 'ethernet' via USB so it won't disrupt your existing LAN and of course doesn't need wifi.

It requires esp-idf v5.5.2 and uses LVGL 8.x compatible code for the test gui.

The windows ncm host driver is not installed automatically at the time of writing but linux should auto-install. Not tested with MacOS.
Use the following procedure to install the correct driver in win 10/11:
After plugging in the dev board it should appear in the windows device manager as an unknown device ('other devices' with a yellow exclamation mark).
Right click on the device entry and select update driver
>Browse my computer for drivers > Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer > select Network adapters > 
choose Microsoft as the manufacturer, and finally pick UsbNcm Host Device from the models, confirming the installation.
Replug the device and head to 192.168.4.1
A powershell script is included to automate the driver install process if prefered (at your own risk!)

If you wish to try alternative ui from Squareline Studio / Squareline Vision / EZstudio then match the project display px dimensions in globals.h

I think this could be really useful - perfect for wifi provisioning and configuration in general.
Also, because the wifi is left free it could make a great pc-espnow gateway and many other types of bridge.

LVGL frame buffer transfer to html canvas is quite slow due to the limited 12Mbit/s USB 1.1 of the S3. 
The ESP-P4 improves things dramatically with USB 2.x @480Mbit/s - see my other repo for an example.

It would be more efficient to use Emscripten to serve WebAssembly and have all the LVGL stuff run in the browser (I'll try that next)
but this approach is maybe useful as all the business code is running on the esp32 - the html canvas is simply a dumb external screen with mouse / touch callback.
Modify index.html to change page background colour and default canvas position offset.
Modify favicon.ico to your taste.
index.html and favicon.ico are embedded as binaries at build time so no file system is needed for the partition.
